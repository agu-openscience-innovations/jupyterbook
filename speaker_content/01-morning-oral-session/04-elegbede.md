# 04 - 	Advancing Open Science in Africa: Bridging Gaps, Enabling Progress through Transformative Solutions

Presented by: Isa Olalekan Elegbede

## Abstract 
Open science has emerged as a transformative movement in the realm of research and scholarly communication, advocating for the transparent sharing of research code, data, and results. This abstract explores the manifold benefits and challenges of open science practices, specifically focusing on their implications for local and African communities. It also delves into the critical issue of data accessibility for Africans and outlines potential transformative solutions to address existing disparities. Open science advocates for transparent sharing of research code, data, and results, enabling collaboration and knowledge exchange. By promoting reproducibility and transparency, open science facilitates evidence-based decision-making and socio-economic development. However, challenges like data privacy, limited access to resources, and the need for a cultural shift exist. Data accessibility is a critical issue in Africa, with disparities hindering full participation in the global scientific community. Transformative solutions, including collaboration, capacity-building, and policy advocacy, offer avenues for enhancing data accessibility and promoting open science principles. Embracing open science can empower African researchers to contribute significantly to global knowledge exchange and drive positive societal change.
