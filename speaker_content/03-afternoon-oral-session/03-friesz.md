# 03 - Community building across government and responding to researcher needs with the NASA Openscapes framework

Presented by: Aaron M Friesz

## Abstract
Open science involves new technologies and new approaches for collaborating, both of which involve learning and developing new skills and habits with intention. Here we’ll share perspectives from the NASA Openscapes Mentor community, where staff from 7+ NASA Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) have been learning together and collaborating to support and pass along best practices to their user communities who are interacting with NASA's Earth data in the Cloud. We have developed teaching skills through Carpentries Instructor Training and Openscapes mentorship as well as technical skills working with the 2i2c JupyterHub, writing tutorials in Python, R, and MATLAB, publishing these resources from GitHub using Quarto to support researchers. Working closely with researchers through workshops, hackathons, and the Openscapes Champions program has given us a direct way to identify researcher pain points in the Cloud – and from there we’ve worked to help solve these pain points, resulting in conceptual cheatsheets, the earthaccess python library, and corn for provisioning multiple kernels inside a JupyterHub. This work is part of the greater open science movement and Year of Open Science. We’ll share specific examples of progress / challenges / lessons we’ve learned with Earth science research teams and from the open science community, including the July 2023 CERN-NASA Open Science Summit and Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP) meeting.
