# 03 - 	Latin American lessons learned on how to do outstanding global open source science (Invited) 

Presented by: Laura Aci√≥n

## Abstract 
The idea that everyone, no matter where they are in the world, should be able to contribute to, engage with, and benefit from the development of science and technology is central to open science and open source. In this talk, we will share our lived experiences and the lessons learned while working and building Latin American open source science communities and capacities. We will explore barriers to globally participating in open source science from Latin America and discuss short-, medium- and long-term actions that researchers, technicians, educators, funders, and others can take to remove some of these barriers. For instance, since healthy communities of practice are crucial to developing and adopting open science, we will reflect on the value of developing connections to co-create work experiences and environments that increase the use of open science, primarily in, but not limited to, Latin America. Furthermore, we will discuss how volunteerism negatively affects diversity and inclusion in open science. We will also present recommendations to build sustainable and locally contextualized open science communities that are healthy and have solid global connections, a path towards outstanding global open science for everyone.
