# Contributing Guide
## Forking
```{tip}
More detail on creating a fork can be found in the GitHub documentation:
https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository
```

Start by forking the repository (in this case https://github.com/agu-openscience-innovations/jupyterbook-2023/) by clicking on the "fork" button in the upper right:

![fork](images/fork.png)

This will create a copy of this repository in your GitHub account. Next, clone the resulting repository with 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/jupyterbook-2023.git
```

This is a copy of the Jupyter Book that you now have write permission with.
