### About the session

Open science can enable truly inclusive, accessible, and reproducible science. As open science becomes widely adopted, itâ€™s important to take the time to meet as a community and share our knowledge, tools, best practices, and challenges so that we can best learn from and support one another. This session will bring together practitioners from the global open science community in fruitful discussions about their experiences and barriers to open science.

This session includes oral presentations, a panel discussion, two workshops, and lots of time for discussion!
