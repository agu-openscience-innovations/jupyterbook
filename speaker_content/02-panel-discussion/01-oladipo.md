Presented by: Mumin Oladipo

## Abstract 
Open science provides access to resources and helps promote inclusiveness in our diverse world. Open science is an important tool towards equity, providing more access to scientific contributions across the world. Open science has helped to improve inclusiveness, accelerating the career path of early careers.

By introspections: Open science provides an opportunity for early careers in the global south to participate in providing insight on global scientific research; It also helps reduce the pressure of migration, since opportunities beyond borders are made available; The rigour of publishing in high-impact journals is cushioned with open science/data because globally relevant data are available and open science advance computing resources help to provide the computational tools for research, giving researchers the ability to focus on the interpretation of the results and communicating the science; Open science community provides an avenue for networking and community service to give back to the society through training, summer schools, and outreach.

As we navigate through the current global and regional crisis: food insecurity, climate change and global warming are mutual enemies we must collectively fight. Open science is a tool that is capable of giving everyone a chance to contribute to promoting global inclusiveness to foster the peace and progress of mankind.
