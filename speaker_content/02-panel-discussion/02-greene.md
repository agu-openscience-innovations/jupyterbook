# 02 - 	Embracing Diversity in Science: Perspectives from Indigenous Communities and Open Science (Invited)

Presented by: Ciarra Greene

## Abstract 
The presentation focuses on the critical intersection of open science principles with Indigenous communities, cultures, and values, data sovereignty, and the integration of traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) into broader knowledge systems relevant. By considering both beneficial and challenging aspects of open science practices, we can foster greater collaboration between Indigenous communities, higher education institutions, and state/federal agencies.

Drawing on successful initiatives that embody Indigenous data sovereignty principles, the presentation highlights how open science can contribute to the empowerment of historically excluded Indigenous voices in science. By ensuring that Indigenous communities have control over their data and are engaged in decision-making processes related to data sharing and use, open science initiatives can create more equitable partnerships.

A key aspect explored in the presentation is the co-production of knowledge that integrates TEK into scientific research. By respecting and integrating Indigenous perspectives, open science approaches can lead to more comprehensive and culturally sensitive approaches to environmental stewardship. This integration also holds the potential to enhance the overall understanding of complex ecological systems and contribute to global sustainability efforts.

However, the presentation also acknowledges the challenges that arise when implementing open science principles in collaboration with Indigenous communities. Issues related to intellectual property rights, ethical considerations, and the need for culturally appropriate engagement are carefully examined. By recognizing and addressing these challenges, we can develop strategies for building robust and respectful open science partnerships.

We all carry the responsibility to collectively shape an open science landscape that embraces diversity, honors Indigenous knowledge systems, and leads to a more inclusive and sustainable future for scientific research and environmental stewardship.
