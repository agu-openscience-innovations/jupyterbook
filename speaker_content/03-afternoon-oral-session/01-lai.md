# 01 - Geomorphica: The Diamond Open-Access Journal for Geomorphology

## Abstract
Geomorphica (http://geomorphica.org) is a community-led and -driven scientific journal that fosters academic discourse and research advances in the field of geomorphology. It is hosted by Penn State University Libraries and supported by the International Association of Geomorphology. Geomorphica adds to the growing family of Diamond Open-Access journals in the Geosciences next to Volcanica, Tektonika, Seismica, and Sedimentologika, offering free public access without subscription fees and article processing charges to promote inclusivity and eliminating barriers in scientific communication. Over the past two years, we have established an initiative with more than 30 volunteers who contribute to all functions including administration, editing, reviewing, typesetting, and visual branding. Geomorphica has been officially launched since June 2023 and is open for manuscript submissions related (but not limited) to landscapes and landforms, Earth’s and planetary near-surface processes, and the mechanisms, dynamics and timescales pertaining to these processes. Experts in related fields are encouraged to join our reviewer database (https://geomorphicaadmin.pythonanywhere.com/), participating in the quality control of scientific advances. To reduce bias, we have developed a triple-anonymous review policy, whereby the authors, reviewers and the associate editor making the recommendation are anonymous to each other. The reviewer’s reports and authors’ rebuttals will become publicly available along with the published articles. In this presentation, we will introduce our diverse editorial board, celebrate our first article submissions, and share our experiences during recent progress. We welcome feedback from the broader community to help us continually improve Geomorphica and look forward to your involvement with the initiative.
